<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>If you are a frequent user of YouTube, surely on more than one occasion you have thought&nbsp;</span><strong><span>about why it does not offer the possibility of downloading videos</span></strong><span>&nbsp;from the platform, but it is something that Google does not admit, since there are different legal aspects that have to do with rights. author of many of the contents of the platform.</span></p>
